# SampAccess
This cross-platform .NET library simplify your access to SA:MP servers (gather information about them) and to SA:MP client settings

## Requirements
  - .NET 5 â€” https://dotnet.microsoft.com/

## Note
I wrote this library as an analogue under the MIT license, since those that I found on the Internet were either proprietary or under the GPL license, which is not always suitable.
